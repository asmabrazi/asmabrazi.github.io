Asma Brazi is a PhD candidate at CEA-List and LIGM (École des Ponts ParisTech). Her doctoral research focuses on 6D object pose distribution estimation from a single RGB image and object CAD model, exploring probabilistic and learning-based approaches for robust 3D perception.

Before beginning her PhD, she earned two master’s degrees: one in Agents Distribués, Robotique, Recherche Opérationnelle, Interaction et Décision (ANDROIDE) from Sorbonne University, and another in Vision et Machine Intelligente (VMI) from Paris Descartes University.

Her research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning, particularly in representation learning, object localization, and 3D scene understanding.
